Project Decription:

The project is to predict future stock prices using LSTM, GRU and Auto-Arima.

Project Structure:

1. "AMUC Stock Prediction.ipynb" consists of the complete code required to predict stock prices.
2. "Stock Prediction Demo.ipynb" consists of the sample code used to test different models on stock data to check predictions.
3. "Results" directory consists of the sample outputs obtained by executing "Stock Prediction Demo.ipynb".
4. "TickersYahoo.csv" consists of all the tickers and their corresponding companies that Yahoo Finance API supports.
5. "Stock_pred_model_gru.h5" and "Stock_pred_model_lstm.h5" are the respective h5 files of GRU and LSTM trained models.

Project Implementation:

Run "AMUC Stock Prediction.ipynb" in Jupyter Notebook and obtain the required results and to improve the accuracy tune the hyper-parameters of the model in "Stock Prediction Demo.ipynb".
